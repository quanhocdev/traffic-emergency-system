# 🚨 Traffic Incident Warning & Emergency Response System (Backend Focus)

CanhBaoSuCo is a server-side platform designed to handle traffic incident reporting and emergency response coordination in real-time.

---

## 📌 Overview

The system focuses on:
- Processing user-reported traffic incidents  
- Providing geo-based incident filtering  
- Handling emergency SOS requests  
- Managing users, roles, and reward systems  
- Supporting mobile clients via REST APIs  

⚠️ Android application is only a client consuming backend APIs.

## 🚀 Key Backend Features

### 📍 Incident Management System
- Create, update, delete traffic incidents  
- Store incident types: accident, congestion, breakdown  
- REST APIs for full incident lifecycle management  

---

### 🌍 Geo-based Query System
- Retrieve incidents within a radius (R km)  
- Location-based filtering using latitude/longitude  
- Optimize user experience with nearby incident detection  

---

### 🆘 Emergency SOS System
- Handle real-time SOS requests from users  
- Route emergency signals to nearest support centers  
- Prioritize critical incidents  

---

### 👤 Authentication & Authorization
- Google OAuth2 login integration  
- Role-based access control (USER / ADMIN)  
- Secure API access using Spring Security  

---

### 🏆 Reward & Reporting System
- User-generated incident reporting  
- Basic reward/point system for contributions  
- Anti-spam validation for reports  

---

### 🏢 Admin Management APIs
- Manage incidents and user reports  
- Approve/reject reported incidents  
- System monitoring endpoints for admin dashboard

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a Client–Server architecture:


Android App (Client)
↓
REST API (Spring Boot Backend)
↓
Business Logic Layer
↓
MySQL Database


### Backend Responsibilities
- Business logic processing  
- Data validation & security  
- Geo-based computation  
- Incident & SOS handling  

### Client Responsibilities
- Displaying data  
- Sending user location  
- Triggering API requests
